# Minimark

Minimark is a Minimal Markdown editor for web publishing.


## Usage

From any directory with Markdown files, run:

```sh
minimark
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/`.

- Loads the most recently modified `.md` file in the current directory (creates `untitled.md` if none exist).
- Autosaves the file after 500ms of inactivity while typing.
- Serves a minimal UI (HTML/CSS/JS) embedded in the binaryâ€”no extra files are written in your working directory.

### HTML Export (cmark-gfm)

If `cmark-gfm` is installed and on your `PATH`, Minimark will automatically export the current file you are editing to an HTML file under `./docs` after each save.

You can disable automatic export with the `-export=false` flag:

```sh
minimark -export=false
```

#### Optional header/footer and static includes

- Place `header.html` and/or `footer.html` in a local `_includes/` directory. On export, Minimark wraps the converted HTML as:
  - `header.html` (if present) + converted Markdown + `footer.html` (if present)
- On startup, all files inside your local `_includes/` are copied into `./docs` (recursively). Use this to ship CSS/JS/images referenced by your header/footer.
- If `_includes/` is missing, wrapping is skipped and no files are copied.

#### Installing cmark-gfm

```sh
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install cmark-gfm

# Debian/Ubuntu (if available in your release)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmark-gfm

# Debian/Ubuntu (build from source if package not found)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git
git clone https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm.git
cd cmark-gfm
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMARK_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build -j
sudo cmake --install build

# Windows options
# 1) Recommended: Use WSL and follow Debian/Ubuntu steps above
# 2) Or build from source with CMake + Visual Studio (Developer Prompt):
#    - Install CMake (https://cmake.org/download/) and VS Build Tools
#    - Then run the same cmake build steps in a native shell
```

Optional flag:

```sh
minimark -addr localhost:8080
```


## Build and Install

Requirements: Go 1.21+

Using Makefile targets:

```sh
# Build locally (outputs bin/minimark)
make build

# Install globally (uses go install to GOBIN or GOPATH/bin)
make install

# Run in place for development
make run
```

Ensure `GOBIN` (or `GOPATH/bin`) is on your `PATH` to run the installed binary from anywhere.


## Notes

- All UI assets in `static/` are embedded into the binary via `go:embed`.
- Only Markdown files live in your working directory for a clean setup.
